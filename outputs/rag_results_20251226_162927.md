## Q2 – Mid-Year Reality Check - Part 1

**Question:** According to Mid-Year Outlook 2025: Which forecasted themes played out as expected?

**Route:** midyear

**Documents Retrieved:** 12

**Sources:** midyear

**Answer:**

|Forecasted Themes Played Out|Evidence|Supported|
|------------------------------|----------|-----------|
|AI-driven productivity gains; capex growth|33% capex growth from hyperscalers|Yes [11]|
|Resilience in U.S. markets; tariff impacts|U.S. policy shaping markets; growth-friendly|Partial [7]|
|Concerns over AI saturation; valuation questions|AI stocks faced sell-off; questioning resources|Yes [11]|

The table summarizes the forecasted themes that played out as expected according to the Mid-Year Outlook 2025. 

1. **AI-driven productivity gains; capex growth**: The document indicates confidence in AI catalyzing productivity gains and notes that Wall Street analysts are now projecting nearly 33% capex growth from major hyperscalers, up from earlier estimates of just over 20% at the start of the year [11].

2. **Resilience in U.S. markets; tariff impacts**: The outlook suggests that U.S. policy will play a significant role in shaping global markets, indicating a degree of resilience despite recession risks. However, this theme is marked as "Partial" because while there is acknowledgment of resilience, the specifics of how this plays out are less clear [7].

3. **Concerns over AI saturation; valuation questions**: The document discusses the sell-off of AI stocks and raises questions about the resources needed for developing high-performing AI models, indicating a concern about valuation and saturation in the AI sector [11]. 

These themes reflect a mix of high confidence in specific growth areas, such as AI, while also acknowledging potential risks and uncertainties in the market landscape.

**Route:** midyear

**Documents Retrieved:** 12

**Sources:** midyear

**Answer:**

|Underperformed/Disappointed|Evidence|Supported|
|-----------------------------|----------|-----------|
|U.S. equities|Non-U.S. markets outperforming; U.S. returns lagging [5]|Yes|
|IPO activity|Slower than 2024 and 2023; capital markets dormant [5]|Yes|

## Q3 – Stock-Level Comparison - Part 1

**Question:** Identify at least two named stocks (e.g. Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA): What was implied or stated about them in the 2025 forecast? How their performance or outlook is described at mid-year 2025

**Route:** both

**Documents Retrieved:** 12

**Sources:** forecast, midyear

**Answer:**

|Stock|2025 Forecast Outlook|Mid-Year 2025 Performance/Outlook|Supported|
|---------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------|
|Microsoft|AI demand; 35% growth in cloud unit|AI demand; 5x increase in AI tokens processed|Yes|
|Magnificent 7|15% EPS growth; outperform rest of market|Underperformed; down over 12% year-to-date|Partial|

**Detailed Explanations:**

1. **Microsoft**: 
   - In the 2025 forecast, Microsoft was highlighted for its significant growth driven by AI demand, specifically noting a 35% growth in its cloud computing unit attributed to AI applications. The document emphasized the company's processing of over 100 trillion AI tokens, marking a 5x increase from the previous year, indicating strong performance expectations [3][11].
   - By mid-year 2025, the outlook remained positive, with AI demand continuing to drive growth, reinforcing the earlier forecast. This suggests that Microsoft is effectively capitalizing on the AI trend, aligning with the forecasted expectations [1].

2. **Magnificent 7**: 
   - The forecast indicated that the Magnificent 7 stocks were expected to deliver a 15% EPS growth in 2025, outperforming the broader market, which was projected to grow at 8% [3]. This group includes major tech companies, suggesting a strong outlook based on their market positioning and growth potential.
   - However, by mid-year 2025, the Magnificent 7 had underperformed, with a decline of over 12% year-to-date, raising concerns about their aggressive capital expenditure plans and overall market conditions [2]. This indicates a divergence between the optimistic forecast and the actual performance observed in the first half of the year.

## Q4 – Valuation and Risk - Part 1

**Question:** What valuation or risk concerns were highlighted at the start of 2025? Which of those risks materialized by mid-year, according to J.P. Morgan?

**Route:** both

**Documents Retrieved:** 12

**Sources:** forecast, midyear

**Answer:**

|Valuation/Risk Concerns (Start 2025)|Risks Materialized by Mid-Year|Supported|
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------|
|Geopolitical risks; Middle East, Ukraine|Recession risks increased; policy uncertainty|Yes [1], [3]|
|Elevated equity/credit valuations|Limited public market liquidity; M&A growth revised down|Yes [4], [12]|
|Tariff-driven uncertainty|Choppy equity markets; IPO activity quiet|Yes [12]|
|Election cycle impacts|Prolonged uncertainty clouding dealmaking outlook|Yes [12]|

At the start of 2025, J.P. Morgan highlighted several valuation and risk concerns, including geopolitical risks from ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, elevated equity and credit valuations, tariff-driven uncertainty, and potential impacts from the election cycle [1]. By mid-year, these risks materialized as recession risks increased, public market liquidity remained limited, and expectations for M&A growth were revised down significantly from 25% to just 7% [3], [12]. Additionally, the anticipated revival in dealmaking faced challenges due to ongoing uncertainty and choppy equity markets, leading to a quiet IPO environment [12]. 

The concerns about elevated valuations and geopolitical risks were confirmed as significant factors affecting market dynamics throughout the first half of 2025.

## Q5 – Structured Output - Part 1

**Question:** Produce the following table: | Stock / Theme | 2025 Forecast View | Mid-Year 2025 Reality | Supported? (Yes/No) | Citation |

**Route:** both

**Documents Retrieved:** 12

**Sources:** forecast, midyear

**Answer:**

|Stock / Theme|2025 Forecast View|Mid-Year 2025 Reality|Supported?|Citation|
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------|----------|
|Easing Global Policy|Rate cuts; support growth|Elevated valuations; mixed outcomes|Partial|[1], [3]|
|Accelerating Capital Investment|AI; power; security sectors to benefit|Infrastructure demand; power generation|Yes|[10], [3]|
|Portfolio Resilience|Balanced positioning; income focus|Hedge funds; infrastructure investments|Yes|[1], [3]|
|Dealmaking|Potential rebound; private equity growth|Bank M&A activity; cautious optimism|Yes|[1], [9]|
|Emerging Markets|Cyclical assets; growth opportunities|Earnings lag; mixed performance|Partial|[6], [3]|

**Explanations:**

This leads to a "Partial" support rating as the initial forecast did not fully materialize. 

2. **Accelerating Capital Investment**: The forecast emphasized sectors like AI, power, and security as beneficiaries of capital investment. The mid-year reality confirmed strong demand in infrastructure and power generation, supporting a "Yes" rating for this theme.

3. **Portfolio Resilience**: The forecast called for balanced positioning and a focus on income, which aligns with mid-year insights on hedge funds and infrastructure investments providing resilience. This theme is fully supported, hence a "Yes" rating.

4. **Dealmaking**: The forecast anticipated a rebound in dealmaking and private equity growth. Mid-year observations noted increased M&A activity in the banking sector, supporting this theme with a "Yes" rating.

5. **Emerging Markets**: The forecast suggested opportunities in cyclical assets, but mid-year analysis indicated that earnings growth was lagging behind expectations, leading to a "Partial" support rating for this theme.
